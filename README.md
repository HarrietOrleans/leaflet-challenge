Module 15 Challenge

This module challenge had us visualize earthquake data from USGS GeoJSON Feed with Leaflet.

This was a fun challenge and I really enjoyed it. I was able to use class assignments and review our class recordings to complete this assignment. I really enjoyed how versitile mapping with Leaflet is - I could easily change out my endpoint and get different visualizations! I originally chose the significant earthquakes for the past 30 days as my endpoint, but after I saw how sparse it was, it was easily able to change my endpoint to M4.5+ Earthquakes and I had so many more interesting data points to look it. This is definitly something that I will continue practicing with in the future as I see the value in the information that it provides.
